This is my first program that fully works and I'm proud of it. I enjoyed using association as it felt more like programming a "Real world object" than pointless code. i ran into some issues passing the command line string for an argument, but was eventually able to get it to work and was glad that worked! Resizing the banner took some logic and trial and error but that worked great too. I, unfortunately, did not have the space to work with someone else on this project but I learnt that some projects I can do alone while other projects would require help from other students. All in all, this was my favourite homeworkassignment so far. I would encourage future students to get started on assignments as soon as possible so that they have the space to play around and get creative with the task.
